/*Q1. Difference between Delete and truncate*/
--Triggers will get fired while applying delete. Triggers will not get fired in truncate. To Prove this below is the code
select * from tb1;
--Loop to insert some records in table
set SERVEROUTPUT on;
declare 
v_count number;
BEGIN
    for v_count in 1..10
    loop
    insert into tb1 values(v_count);
    end loop;
end;    
--This raise the error if we execute delete command
create or replace trigger tr_delete
before delete on tb1 for EACH ROW
BEGIN
    raise_application_error(-20000,'Trigger is fired');
end;
--When we execute delete the trigger got raise hence its prove that trigger gets fire when we execute delete
delete from tb1;
--Trigger doesnt fire hence its prove that truncate doesnt raise trigger
TRUNCATE TABLE tb1;
